defmodule Riax.VNode do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  A virtual node is an Elixir (or Erlang) process responsible for a partition of
  keys from [the ring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambdaclass/riak_core_tutorial/master/ring.png).
  The key word here is virtual (as opposed to physical), because we can have
  many virtual nodes running on a physical node. In the picture, the colored
  squares are physical nodes. With consistent hashing, we can determine which
  node should handle a given key, depending on which partition (and therefore,
  VNode) the key ends up. The way that keys are distributed is the Handoff,
  which is explained on a section below. The virtual node is responsible for
  handling requests and can store data to be retrieved. It is important to bear
  in mind that VNodes are not bound to a particular to a particular physical
  node. They can be relocated to another physical nodes as new nodes are added
  (using Riax.join) or a certain physical node is not available. Adding new
  nodes easily is useful for horizontal scaling.

  To implement this Virtual Node, we provide an easy to use behaviour. Here's an
  example of using a Virtual Node as a Key-Value store.
  # Example

        {:ok, state}

 ```

  If our setup is working, we can call it using the Riax module

  Example:
 ```
    iex(dev1@127.0.0.1)> Riax.sync_command 1, {:ping, 1}
        17:05:35.559 [debug] Received ping command!
        {:pong, 2, :"dev1@127.0.0.1", 822094670998632891489572718402909198556462055424}
    iex(dev1@127.0.0.1)2> Riax.sync_command(:some_identifier, {:put, {:my_key, :my_value}})
        17:09:57.727 [debug] PUT Key: :my_key, Value: :my_value
        :ok
    iex(dev1@127.0.0.1)3> Riax.sync_command(:some_identifier, {:get, :my_key})
        17:10:11.336 [debug] GET my_key
        :my_value
    iex(dev1@127.0.0.1)4> Riax.preferred_node(:some_identifier)
        {:ok, {639406966332270026714112114313373821099470487552, :"dev1@127.0.0.1"}}
  ```
   This tells us the key `:my_key` and value `:my_value` pair
   ended up in the Virtual Node `:"dev1@127.0.0.1"`

  # Handoff :

    Ownership of a partition (that is, key distribution between nodes) may be
    transferred from one virtual node to another in a different node when nodes
    join (via `Riax.join/1`) or are removed from the cluster, and under certain
    failure scenarios to guarantee high availability. If a node goes down
    unexpectedly, the partitions owned by the virtual nodes it contained will be
    temporarily handled by virtual nodes in other physical nodes. If the
    original node comes back up, ownership will eventually be transferred back
    to the original owners, also called primary virtual nodes. The virtual nodes
    that took over ownership in that scenario are called secondary virtual
    nodes. The process by which this ownership is negotiated and any relevant
    data is transferred to accomplish that is what we call a handoff. Transfer
    of ownership may also occur when adding or removing physical nodes to the
    cluster.

  # Handoff process:

    First of all, keep in mind that when the handoff is in progress,
    a VNode will handle its requests via `handle_handoff_command/3`,
    it can drop the request, forward it or handle it.
    When the handoff starts it works like this:

    1. The callback `handoff_starting/2` is called. If it returns a `{:false,
       state}` tuple, the handoff is cancelled. Else, it calls `is_empty/1` to
       check if the VNode has something to hand off.

    2. If `is_empty/1` it returns a `:false` tuple, the handoff continues

    3. `handle_handoff_fold/3` is called with a folding function and an
       accumulator as parameters. The provided accumulator works just fine with
       the Enum module. The given fold_function turns the VNode's state into
       key-value pairs (see the example) and, before sending them to its
       corresponding Virtual Node, calls encode_handoff_item/2 to encode them.

    4. Said encoding will be then decoded by `handle_handoff_data/2` in the receiving
       Virtual Node. When all the key-values are sent, `handoff_finished/2` is called.
